## Notice

This is a copy of the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` project, plus additional changes made by 
https://github.com/NinoFloris to support additional capabilities discussed here:

Full Credit goes to Microsoft, plus https://github.com/NinoFloris for this code - which is licenced under the MIT licence.

Microsoft aren't in a hurry to accept the proposed changes, so in the interim, I have pulled the changes into my project.
