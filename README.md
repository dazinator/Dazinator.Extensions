## Intro

This repository builds on `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions` to provide additional features, which currently are:

- Named Services
- Child Containers

It also provides a seperate nuget package called `Dazinator.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Microsoft` which basically contains a copy of the native MS `ServiceProvider` but with some changes as published here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/45497

## Named Services

Allows you to register services that can be resolved by name.

For more detailed docs [see here](./src/DependencyInjection.NamedServices/README.md)

## Child Containers

For more detailed docs [see here](./src/DependencyInjection.ChildContainers/README.md)

Allows you to configure "child containers" using the normal `IServiceCollection` interface.
The child service provider can be implemented by your `conforming container` of choice i.e Autofac, Structuremap, Microsoft DI - any DI package that supports IServiceProvider.

It means, thanks to a standard interface for building / configuring child containers, you can take a DI container library that doesn't have a child container feature,
(like I did with Microsofts) and create "child containers" with it! The caveat is that:

    - Your DI container of choice must support building a container from an `IServiceCollection` or IEnumerable<ServiceDescriptor>`
    
If you are interested in that, look at the tests for `ChildServiceCollection`

For docs, [see here](./src/DependencyInjection.ChildContainers/README.md)
